## GIT terms 

Here are some of the most important terms related to Git, explained within the context of a house and using the 5W rule:

1. **Repository (Repo)**: 
    - *House Context*: Think of the entire house blueprint.
    - *5W Rule*: A repository is where the entire history and files for a project are stored, allowing developers to track and manage changes to the project over time.

2. **Commit**: 
    - *House Context*: It's like noting a change or addition in the house's design.
    - *5W Rule*: A commit represents a snapshot of the code at a particular point, encapsulating who made the change, what was changed, when, and why.

3. **Branch**: 
    - *House Context*: Visualize different design variations of a room.

    - *House Context*: Combining the features of two room designs into one.
    - *5W Rule*: Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another, ensuring that all the alterations fit seamlessly.

5. **Clone**: 
    - *House Context*: It's like building a replica of your house.
    - *5W Rule*: Cloning involves creating a local copy of a Git repository, allowing developers to work offline and then sync their changes.

6. **Pull**: 
    - *House Context*: Fetching a piece of decor to include in your home.
